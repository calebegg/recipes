# Cornbread

## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons Earth Balance (or other butter equivalent)
- 1 ½ cups cornmeal
- ½ cup AP flour
- 1 ½ tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- ½ cup sugar
- 2 Tbsp flax meal
- 1¼ cups almond or oat milk, more if needed

## Steps

1. Prepare flax eggs by stirring together flax meal with 5 Tbsp water. Let sit 10 minutes.
1. Preheat oven to 375. Put Earth Balance in a 10" cast iron skillet in the oven to melt.
1. Combine dry ingredients and stir in wet ingredients; don't over-mix. If mixture seems dry, add another Tbsp or two of milk
1. When butter has melted, remove the pan from the oven, pour in the batter, and smooth out the top. Return pan to oven for 30 minutes, until top is lightly browned, sides have pulled away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
