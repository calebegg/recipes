# Roasted Kale

## Ingredients

- 1-2 bunches kale
- About 4 oz roasted salted cashews
- Olive oil
- Nutritional yeast
- Balsamic vinegar
- Salt/pepper

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 400
1. Add cashews and a tbsp or two of olive oil to a food processor and process, adding more oil as necessary to form a peanut-butter-like paste. Add nooch (a few big sprinkles), balsamic (a few splashes), salt & pepper to taste; mixture should now be a little runnier than peanut butter, add more oil if it isn't. You can also add other spices and stuff here as you see fit.
1. Tear kale off stalks and cut or tear into bite-sized pieces; wash and dry pieces and put in a big bowl. It will seem like too much kale but in the end it will be too little.
1. Toss the cashew mixture into the kale. It's helpful at this point to use your bare hands to rub the mixture into the leaves and make sure there are no big clumps of mixture left.
1. Put the mixture into a pan; we use a 9x13 pyrex. Put it in the oven.
1. Cook for 30-40 minutes, checking on it every 5 minutes and stirring it around if the top leaves are starting to burn

## Notes/tips

- You can make up one bunch of kale as above, with a second bunch ready, cook the one bunch for ~5 minutes and add the second bunch, if it's too much to fit in the pan in one go. It cooks down a lot even after just a few minutes.
- Sometimes it's too soggy; one thing we've done is we took it out of the oven for about 20 minutes after it was done and let it air dry, then put it back in for 3-4 minutes to get it back up to temp.
