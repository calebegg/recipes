# Collard Greens

## Ingredients

- About 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 Tbsp garlic, minced
- A package of tempeh bacon (Tofurky's treehouse tempeh is good)
- 1-2 cups veggie broth or water
- 3-4 lbs (2 big bunches) collard greens, stemmed and sliced into 1 inch ribbons
- Â½ tsp crushed red pepper
- 1 tsp liquid smoke
- 1 Tbsp liquid aminos or soy sauce
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Steps

1. Heat oil in a big pot (the bigger the better!). Add garlic and saute for about 30 seconds. Add tempeh and cook a few minutes (check package instructions) until it's crispy and basically done
1. Add enough veggie broth to cover the bottom of the pan to about half an inch. Add as much of the greens as you can without compromising your ability to stir, and stir them in.
1. After about 30 seconds they should have cooked down enough to push them to one side of the pan with your spoon so some of the pan is empty. Check that there's still broth on the bottom of the pan and re-up if necessary, then add another handful. Stir together, or use tongs to mix the cooked and new greens.
1. Repeat step 3 until you have no more greens. Reduce heat to a simmer and simmer for 25-45 minutes, stirring occasionally and checking for the consistency you like.
1. Add rest of ingredients, taste and adjust seasoning.

## Notes

It will look like too much to start but it cooks down a lot

This is for relatively "dry" (for lack of a better term) collard greens, like you would put on a plate. Add more veggie broth in step 2 and cook for longer if you like the kind that are more tender/served in a bowl, like you'd usually get at a restaurant.
