# Pat's BBQ Cashew Mac 

**Makes 4 servings**

**Sauce is good for a 12oz (340g) box of macaroni**

**Sauce Ingredients**
- 1 cup raw cashews
- 1 medium white onion (about 2 cups, diced)
- 6 cloves garlic 
- 0.5 teaspoon smoke powder (you can use liquid smoke too, adjust amount as needed)
- 1 tablespoon of apple cider
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 
- 1 teaspoon chili flakes / powder
- 1 teaspoon of cumin 
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast 
- 1 to 2 teaspoons of turmeric (for color) 
- 0.25 cups of veggie stock (I dissolve about a teaspoon of veggie bouillon) 
- 0.5 teaspoon cornstarch

**Topping ideas:**
Toasted bread crumbs,  fresh cilantro, chives or canned diced green chiles

**Instructions:**
1. Prepare the cashews by placing them in a bowl and covering with freshly boiled water, let them sit while you prep the rest of the ingredients. 
2. Dissolve the cornstarch in about a tablespoon of hot water. Add water gradually and stir to prevent lumps.
3. Heat oil (I like coconut, but any will do) and fry up the diced onion till translucent, add garlic, and the dry spices â€” paprika, chili flakes / powder, cumin and tumeric. Heat and keep stirring for a little more till fragrant. Remove from heat. 
4. If using smoke powder, sift to prevent lumps and stir it into the apple cider vinegar 
5. Drain the cashews. Into a blender, place the cashews, fried mixture, the nutritional yeast, the veggie broth, and the smoke powder and vinegar mixture. Add half the cornstarch mixture. Blend till creamy. 
6. Adjustments: The mixture should be smooth and lump-free. Running a spoon through the mixture should be easy and the "valley" should stay. If it appears a little runny, add a little more cornstarch mixture and blend some more. If it's extremely runny, try adding more cashews. If it appears too dry try adding a little pasta water or oil (it should not be stiff like settled peanut butter). Adding more turmeric will make the yellow color more vivid, you can omit the tumeric if you don't like the flavor or don't care about the color.
7. Toss the creamy sauce with macaroni, top and serve. 

**Other notes:** 
- Have yet to try this recipe with a bit of coconut cream mixed in. Can imagine it'd be good in a non-bbq version.
- Great with broccoli / asparagus mixed in.
- A good strong blender / food processor is essential for this recipe.
