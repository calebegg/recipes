# Roasted Brussels sprouts

## Ingredients

- 1-1.5 lbs Brussels sprouts
- Olive oil
- 1 Tbsp minced garlic
- Salt & pepper

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 450
1. Tear off any fucky looking leaves and cut off the bottoms of the sprouts. Halve the small ones and quarter the large ones
1. Toss sprouts with olive oil (start with about 1 Tbsp, add more as needed so they're all shiny).
1. Add salt and pepper to taste
1. Spread on a pyrex dish or baking sheet and roast for 40 minutes, stirring halfway through and checking near the end that they don't get too burnt

## Notes

- Pearl onions prepared similarly are a nice addition
