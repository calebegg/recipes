# Mac & Squash

## Ingredients

- Acorn squash (1 big or 2 small)
- 1 lb elbow macaroni
- 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast (or more, to taste)
- Adobo seasoning mix (or whatever you have from: chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, pepper, paprika) to taste
- About 1 Tbsp mustard or vinegar
- A cup of Daiya shreds or shredded cheese (optional)

## Steps

1. Heat oven to 400Â°F. Cut the squash in half lengthwise and scoop out seeds
1. Place the squash halves cut side down on a baking sheet/dish and roast for about 35 minutes, until tender when pierced with a fork
1. Let the squash cool, then scoop out the flesh
1. Meanwhile, cook the macaroni according to package directions. **Reserve about a cup of the cooking water**.
1. Drain the macaroni and put it back in the pot. Add squash and stir together. It will probably be too thick; add cooking water as necessary to form a sauce
1. Stir in the rest of the ingredients; taste and adjust seasoning

## Notes

- [Adapted from this recipe](https://theveganstoner.blogspot.com/2013/04/mac-and-squash.html)
- The original recipe calls for roasting the squash in the microwave. I've tried that several times but never get a consistent result. The inside gets overcooked and the outside is still raw. The oven takes more time but is much better.
