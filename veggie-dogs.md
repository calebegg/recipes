# Veggie dogs

## Ingredients

- 4 pack of Tofurkey italian sausage or Beyond Sausage Hot Italian
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- Spoonful of minced garlic
- Medium onion, cut into strips
- Large red bell pepper, cut into strips
- Salt
- Mayonnaise
- About 1 cup pepperjack or mozzarella shreds
- 4 hotdog buns (top cut is best)

## Steps

1. Sweat garlic, pepper, onion, and a generous sprinkling of salt over medium low heat until onion is softened and translucent, 15-25 minutes. Low and slow is good here, but raise heat if impatient.
1. Raise heat to high and sear veggies until they start to have some blackened bits, stirring regularly, about 5 minutes. At the same time, clear some space in the pan and add the sausages, rotating them regularly with tongs. They should finish at about the same time as the veggies.
1. Sprinkle shreds on veggies near the end, stirring a bit so they heat up and melt but avoid burning
1. Spread mayo generously on buns. Add sausages and top with veggie/cheese mixture.

## Notes

- Based largely on a menu item, The Natural, at a Norman, OK area restaurant called Diamond Dawgs.
