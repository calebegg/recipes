# Quesadillas

## Ingredients

- Pepperjack and/or cheddar style shreds
- Burrito sized tortillas
- Sauteed & seasoned fillings -- mushrooms, pepper, onions, etc, from [fajita taco recipe](fajita-tacos.md)

## Steps

1. Clean out the big nonstick skillet from the fajita veggies with a paper towel. Heat over medium high heat for a few minutes
1. While that's heating up, spread out an even layer of shreds over the entire tortilla and microwave for 1-1.5 minutes, until shreds are mostly melted. Tortilla will be kinda wet and very soft from the microwave; that's fine.
1. Add toppings to half and fold. Place on nonstick skillet for about 30 seconds per side, until excess water is evaporated and the tortilla is lighly browned. Use caution when flipping! Always flip along the fold
1. Slice with a pizza cutter into four approximately equal pieces

## Notes

- If making for a group, these steps can be parallelized nicely -- have a queue of plates with tortillas, and prep one while you microwave the next and toast the one after.
