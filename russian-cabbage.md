# Russian cabbage

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp neutral oil or Earth Balance
- 1 generous spoonful minced garlic (2-4 cloves)
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 small or 1/2 large head of cabbage, shredded. About 6 cups
- 1 cup vegetable stock (we like [Better than Bullion](https://www.betterthanbouillon.com/products/no-chicken-base/))
- 1 large can diced or crushed tomatoes
- 1/2 cup sour cream (fine to estimate, we like Violife or Tofutti)
- salt and pepper

## Steps

1. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pan that has a lid, over medium heat.
1. Add the garlic and onion and cook until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes.
1. Add the cumin seeds and cook for another minute.
1. Add the shredded cabbage and cook for a few minutes until it begins to brown.
1. Add the stock, cover and cook for another 8-10 minutes or so, until the cabbage is tender.
1. Remove the lid, turn up the heat slightly and add the tomatoes, along with a sprinkling of salt. Cook, stirring frequently for another 8-10 minutes, until most of the liquid boils away. Think sauce not soup.
1. Turn off the heat. Add the sour cream and stir in for a minute or two.
1. Salt and pepper to taste.

Serve with [cornbread](cornbread.md) or as a side dish.

## Notes

- Thickens a little on standing and tastes really great as reheated leftovers the next day.
